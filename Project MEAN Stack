#MEAN STACK DEPLOYMENT TO UBUNTU IN AWS SERVER

MEAN Stack is a combination of 
. MongoDB - It is Document Database that stores and allows to retreive data.
. Express - It is a Back-end application framework that makes request to Database for Reads and Writes.
. Angular - It is a Front-end application framework that handles Clients and Server Request.
. Node.js - It is JavaScript runtme environment that accepts requests and displays results to an end user.

The task is to Implement a simple Book Register Web Form using MEAN Stack.

Step 1 - Connect to AWS server using Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS
       - Changed Hostname to ProjectMEANstackserver to identify project name.

     ## Installing **MongodDB**##
     
       - Start the Server
       - Verify that service is up and running
       
       
       ![images of mongodb]()
       
       
       - Install **npm -Node** package manager
       
       - Install**body-parser** package
       
       
       
       ![images of npm and body-parser]()
       
       
       
         - Creating a Folder Named **BOOKS**
         
         - Initialize in the Book directory  and *npm* project
         
         - Added file **server.js** and pasted a web server code inside the **server.js**
         
         ![images of server.js command]()
         
         
         
         STEP 3 - ## INSTALLING EXPRESS AND SETTING UP ROUTES TO THE SERVER
         
            - Express is used to pass book information to and from the Mongodb database.
            
             - Installing **mongoose package**
             
             - Created another folder called "apps" in Books directory
             
             - Created File *routes.js* and pasted web code inside it.

             ![images of routes file and code inside]()
             
             
             
             
             
             - Created a folder named *models* in the apps directory.
             
             - In the *models* folder created a file named *book.js*
             
             - Pasted web codes inside the file *book.js*
             
             
             ![images of folder models and file book.js]()
             
             ![images of web code inside the *book.js*]()
             
             
             STEP 4 - ##ACCESS THE ROUTES WITH *AngularJS*
             
             - AngularJS provides a web frame work for creating dynamic views in the web applications.
             
             - Change directory back into *Books*
             
             - Created a folder named *Public*

             ![images of the public folder and file scripts]()
             
             ![images of web code inside script.js]()
             
             
             - In Public folder created file named *index.html*
             
             - Inserted web codes into *index.html*
             
             ![images of index.html file]()
             
             ![images of web code insides index.html]()
             
             
             
             
             - Changed directory back to *Books*
